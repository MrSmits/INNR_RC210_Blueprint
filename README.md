# INNR_RC210_Blueprint
This blueprint creates an automation that translates the ZHA events which are sent by the INNR RC210 smart button (https://www.innr.com/en/product/smart-button/) to actions.

Credits for this blueprint go to the original creator of the blueprint for the RC250 remote. Thank you!


## Prerequisites
- The remote has to be paired with a Zigbee controller using the ZHA integration.
- Due to the use of modern syntax ('actions', 'triggers'), 2024.10 is the minimum HA core version supproted
